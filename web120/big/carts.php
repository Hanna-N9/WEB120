<p>What is a shopping cart? Shopping cart is a piece of software that you find on online sites (they are called eCommerce) that allows the customers to select products, add/delete the products they select, check what they have, and buy it. For example, Amazon.com is an e-commerce website that has an online shopping cart that allows customers to do that. “The easier online shopping is, the more demanding customers are towards the services. Therefore, e-stores have to force themselves to join in a competitive race, in which stores try to fulfill all of the customers’ needs as perfectly and quickly as possible.” (Online Shopping Cart - How Does It Work). Considering the growth of technology, it makes sense for there to be the growth of online shopping as well. There are four simple steps for the shopping cart. First, the customers add goods/services to cart after surfing through a website; second, the site itself is user-friendly (how well are the adjustments in the shopping cart). Thirdly how transparent is the purchasing (“is it concise and convenient with supportive features like automatic address suggestion, diverse payment methods, or multiple shipping options. With a simple click on Submit/Complete order button.” (Online Shopping Cart - How Does It Work)). And lastly, customers buy more by clicking on continue shopping.</p><br /> 

<p>There are two types of shopping carts that every online store must have (one of two) to be able to sell their products to customers functionally. Self-hosted shopping carts are what you host on your server meaning, you download the software and manage it yourself. It runs on a shoestring budget, but they require more time to set up and maintain. (Litwin). If you are interested in this, then here are some examples to consider, such as WooCommerce, Magento, OpenCart, and so on. Their deals and ways are different, so make sure to research before choosing. Another is Hosted shopping carts is what you download and install then the company that created Hosted shopping carts manage it. Hosted shopping carts are perfect for people who are just starting their venture. “They cost more than self-hosted platforms and are less customizable.” (Litwin). If you are interested in this, then some examples include Shopify (“one of the most popular e-commerce platforms around these days” (Litwin)) and BigCommerce.</p><br />
