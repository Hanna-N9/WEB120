<p>A responsive website is built based on HTML and CSS media queries. It can be built for viewing on desktop, tablets, and mobile phones because it automatically responds to the screen size. A mobile app is a software product installed specifically for smartphones and tablets from specific portals like App Store, Google Play, and other portals. For one to create its own website is to pay for domain and hosting while one to develop a mobile app is to have licenses in app stores. “Fifty-eight percent of website visits came from a mobile device in 2018, surpassing desktop usage for the fourth consecutive year. Mobile devices also accounted for 42 percent of total time spent online.” (Ciligot). This showed that both responsive websites and mobile apps could be used on mobile phones, considering that the use of mobile phones is rising.</p><br />
    
<p>Did you know that responsive websites easily have more audiences compared to a mobile app considering that responsive websites can go on all devices while mobile apps can only be on tablets and mobiles. “Because the only thing a user needs to do is click a link to enter your website, it’s much easier to acquire new users with a website than with a mobile app.” (Cherednichenko). But if you are interested in smooth design and for the access to offline/online availability, mobile apps would be better compared to responsive websites. That is, it is possible to access to mobile apps offline. Engagement and interactivity are better with a mobile app since users can have access from anywhere, spend more time with apps, and the design displayed on a mobile app is more convenient and more user-friendly. That means that the responsive websites if on mobile, its functionality has issues since “it will never be as convenient to use as a mobile app because there’s no connection to device hardware. Also, mobile websites are often slower, and their layout is less convenient than that of a mobile app.” In other words, a mobile app has better speed and better performance compared to a responsive website. (Ciligot). But if you want to save money, a responsive website is better since creating websites can be inexpensive and doesn’t require a long duration of time since you can test the change (locally) while building it when on HTML. Whereby it can take time and cost money to build an excellent mobile app. Also, you have to make a significant commitment to the mobile app since you can’t just leave as it is, and it can cost money. It requires you to update and fix bugs in the next versions every time whereby it is faster and easier to update responsive websites which you can do on HTML.</p><br /> 
    
    
<p>Overall, you can choose to do one or both. My recommendation is, if you have a new company, first start with a responsive website so you can save money. And you can acquire new customers by allowing search optimization on Google. If you have a successful company and you are ready to move on to the mobile market, then you can create a mobile app and inform your customers you already have to download and install it. “These are the main criteria for making your choice; however, everything depends on your specific domain, location, and target audience. For example, in some countries people rarely use desktops. Millennials and younger generations also prefer using apps, spending most of their time on the internet in applications.” (Cherednichenko).</p>
