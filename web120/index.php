    <p>My name is Hanna Negash. I was born in Eritrea, a country located in the Horn of Africa. At a young age, I moved to Seattle, and it became my home for more than a decade. Currently, this is my third quarter attending Seattle Central College. I hope to become a programmer after developing my skills and experiences at the college. I want to pursue a BAS degree in Application Development Program at North Seattle College to add more skills and more experiences.</p>
