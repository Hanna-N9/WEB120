<h3>Geography</h3>


<p>Eritrea is located on the Horn of Africa, the region of Eastern Africa. The Horn of Africa is home to four countries: Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, and Eritrea. Eritrea is bordered by North Sudan in the west, Ethiopia in the south, Djibouti in the southeast, and the Red Sea in the east.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Eritrea is a country that has been colonized by a couple of countries. Ottoman Turks first colonized Eritrea in 1557 A.D., and it was under Ottoman for 300 years. When the Turkish empire started to decline in the 1850s slowly, Egypt colonized Eritrea in 1865 for a couple of years. To expand its regime, Egypt invaded other countries, including Ethiopia. This led to a war between Ethiopia and Egypt from 1874 to 1876. Ethiopian Army defeated Egyptians in 1876. Thus Egypt had to leave Eritrea leading Ethiopia to temporarily control Eritrea.</p> 
    
<p>Beside Ethiopia and Liberia, it is well known that European countries colonized African countries. This was called the Berlin Conference that allowed European countries to control Africa. Italy chose Eritrea to colonize in 1889. Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia and Count Pietro Antonelli of Italy signed the Treaty of Wuchale for friendship and trading. The governor of Italy was Ferdinando Martini, and the well-known Prime Minister of Italy was Benito Mussolini. Italy colonized Eritrea in 1890, and colonization went on for 50 years. During the colonization time, Italians influenced changes in Eritrea. The changes influenced Eritrean culinary and transformed the small villages in central area with railway, streets, imported bicycles, and other Italian architectures. Those small villages grew quickly and became one city called Asmara (also spelled Asmera) to symbolize a union of small villages. Italians declared Asmara as a capital city of colonial Eritrea in 1900.</p>
    
<p>After WW2, Italy lost Eritrea to Great Britain; thus, Eritrea was colonized in 1941-1952 by British. British decided to give up Eritrea in 1952, but U.N. was involved because the British stated that Eritrea is a small country, and it needed to be under the control of Ethiopia for only ten years to prepare as an independent nation. U.N. agreed with British. Because Eritrea was under the federation of Ethiopia for ten years, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia betrayed Eritrea. He decided Eritrea to be one province of Ethiopia in 1962. This forced Eritrean people to fight for independence. One can see an old map where Eritrea was not shown.</p>

<p>Because of Ethiopia decision not to free Eritrea after ten years, this led to a long war of 30 years between Ethiopia and Eritrea. After 30 long years of war, Eritrea became an independent nation on May 24, 1991. Independence was confirmed by referendum that resulted in 99.8% in favor in 1993. Eritrea declared Asmara as the capital city of Eritrea in the same year. The war conflict occurred again between Eritrea and Ethiopia from 1998 to 2000. Eritrea and Ethiopia had hostilities for decades as they had a dispute over the border, Badme, between two countries. On the map, Badme touches the border of Eritrea and Ethiopia at the same time. After two decades, in 2018, Ethiopia ceded Badme to Eritrea. Currently, most Eritreans and Ethiopians are friendly with each other, but there are some including governments and politicians that are still on guard with each other. Since the wars and the conflicts were recent.</p>
    
<p>Eritrea was colonized for a common reason. It is because of the geographical location of Eritrea, where it is next to the Red Sea. If one was to look at the map, Eritrea bordered the Red Sea which is perfect for natural resources, fishing, and transportation which led other countries to have eyes on for centuries.</p>
