Nine tribes and languages are Afar, Blien, Hidareb, Kunama, Nara, Rashaida, Saho, Tigre and Tigrinya.

<h3>Religion</h3>

<p>Eritrea is nearly split in two religions: Christian and Muslim. Despite the difference Between Christian and Muslim religions, Eritreans live together peacefully, and there were never potential for conflicts.</p>

<h3>Social norms</h3>
    

<p>To first understand how people behave in Eritrea, the country is first of all a collectivistic society. Families and communities are well emphasized over individualistic culture in Eritrea. When they were young, they were taught to be humble, generous, and attentive to others' needs. Because the country is a collectivistic society, the parents do not force their kids out of their houses when they reach the age of 18. That is, they stay in their parents' house until they marry. Eritrea is also a hierarchical society, mainly where youngsters give enormous respect to those who are older than them.</p>


<p>This is the same case for Ethiopia. The social norms of Eritrea and Ethiopia are about the same.</p>
